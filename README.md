# Enigma Self-Assessment

### Functionality

Meets Expectations(3) - Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented

Got mixed up with some of the instructions but the encrypt & decrypt work.

### OOP

Meets Expectations - Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about. Student can articulate the single responsibilities of the various components.

Could have potentially used more modules / different class structure but took too long at the beginning trying to include & consider them so just ended up making sure my classes didn't really rely on each other outside of obtaining needed information.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics

Meets Expectations(3) - Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen. At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.

The offset file & beginning of the shift file do not look like that on my IDE.

### TDD

Inbetween Meets Expectations & Below Expectations (2.5)

Could have considered more edge cases and was stuck for a while when I realized I missed certain cases in my offset / shift class.

### Version Control

Meets Expectations(3) Minimum 30 commits and 3 pull requests. More than half of your pull requests include related and logical chunks of functionality, and are named and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request. No more than 3 commits include multiple pieces of functionality.

Definitely some padded ones at the end, mostly for refactoring and edits but otherwise pretty consistent PRs and commits.
